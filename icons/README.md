# Icons Directory

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements:
- All icons must be PNG format
- Icons should have transparent backgrounds
- Design should be simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using a text/writing theme (like a pen, document, or "A→B" symbol)

## Design Suggestions:
- A simple document with an arrow or refresh symbol
- Text "A→B" in a clean font
- A stylized pen/pencil icon
- Quote marks with an arrow

## Creating Icons:
You can create these icons using:
- Canva (free online design tool)
- GIMP (free image editor)
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma (free design tool)
- Online favicon generators

## Temporary Workaround:
Until you add proper icons, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders or the extension will use Chrome's default icon.

## Note:
The manifest.json file is already configured to look for these icon files in this directory.
